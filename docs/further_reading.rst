===============

- The `Hyperbolica Devlog playlist`_ on YouTube provides a great introduction to hyperbolic and spherical space. Its `third video`_ is a great starting point to the topic of rendering hyperbolic or spherical space.
- Grant Senderson's and Ben Eater's explorable video series `Visualizing Quaternions`_ is very helpful to get an intuitive feeling for quaternions.
- Jeff Weeks' `Topology and Geometry Software`_ site provides some cool software to get to know unusual spaces. The `Curved Spaces`_ app is the most relevant for the topic of 3-sphere rendering.
