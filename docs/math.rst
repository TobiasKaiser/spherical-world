Mathematics of the 3-sphere
===========================

3-sphere
--------

The 3-sphere can be defined as the set of unit quaternions:

.. math::

    S^3 = \left\{ a + b i = c j + d k \mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 \right\}


Symmetry group of the 3-sphere
------------------------------

Isometry group of R3: Euclidean group E3. Can be represented as translation vector and rotation matrix, either separate or combined into homogenous matrix (subgroup of the affine group), or a translation vector and a unit quaternion for rotation

Isometry group of R4...

Problem is: isometries of R4 can also move the sphere itelf away from the origin. The isometries that are interesting for us are the ones that preserve the 3-sphere. Apart from this condition, we want to make cover all degrees of freedom in movement in rotation. Solution SO4

The elements of SO4 perform movement (translation) and rotation of objects such as the camera or models that lie on the 3-sphere.

SO4 can be described as pairs of quaternions, left- and right-isoclinic rotations...

Geometry on the 3-sphere
------------------------

- Area of a
- Antipodes
- Straight lines are circles, can be divided into two semicircles.
- planes are 2-spheres
- E 3-sphere can be divided by planes of maximal size (todo) into two equally sized half 3-spheres...
